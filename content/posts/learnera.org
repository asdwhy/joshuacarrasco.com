Project Learnera is a collaboration project with [[https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/thebridge/][The Bridge]] from [[https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/][UTSC]]. The goal of the project is to tackle the African Impact Challenge by creating a web platform that combines a community and an E-Learning platform. The goal of the African Impact Challenge is to build the Africa we want to see, by investing in the continent's aspiring entrepreneurs-to-be. The goal is to enable them to build market-creating innovations, which tackle their country's biggest challenges with technology.

We worked on the project from May 2021 to August 2021. The name of our development team was Brute Force Solutions, but we later changed the product name to Learnera.

Features requested at start of development by the product owner:

- Individual profile creations which use the data from the applications/registrations in an automated way, to guide each personâ€™s user journey and recommended actions.
- Company profile creations with consent-provided access to uploaded information by the founding teams on pitch decks, financials, MCs, founding team, etc.
- Partner profile creations (investors, service providers, corporations) with relevant information about them.
- Enabling organic and guided interaction within this community.
- Virtual pre-recorded content (video/audio and visual) that can be consumed in a self-paced manner.
- Deliverable completion and submission.
- Calendar and scheduling features for participants in the incubation program.
- Video conferencing integration for live workshops/sessions.
