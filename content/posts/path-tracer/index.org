* Description

In university I took a computer graphics course and I really enjoyed it! I wanted to take it to the next level and re-wrote the project in Rust and added some features from the classic [[https://raytracing.github.io/][Ray Tracing in One Weekend Series]].

Here are some images that I rendered:
